# UWB Positioning Click-on

> Part number: `UWB-1.0`<br/>
> Datasheet: *coming soon*.

The UWB click-on sensor, coming soon, will enable ultrawide-band positioning,
and deliver sub-meter 3D accuracy. In addition, it will provide barometric
pressure sensing, to aid height estimation.

Added on the WiTTRA Sense 360, the device will perform time-of-flight ranging
to nearby Positioning Beacons also equipped with the click-on. The Wittra
positioning engine will then fuse UWB data with barometric pressure,
as well as potentially RSSI and ToF over the sub-GHz network, to deliver
the best tracking accuracy.
