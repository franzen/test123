# Mioty

The MiotySense360 implements the Mioty Allianceâ€™s standard stack, enabling scalable long-range communication with high resilience to interference.
To enable Mioty, you need a [Unified Gateway](products-gateway.md) with a [Mioty HAT](products-mioty-hat.md) mounted.

At the core of the technology lies the innovative Telegram Splitting Multiple Access (TSMA), defined by ETSI.
Mioty devices split their messages into multiple small telegrams sent over different frequencies.
This, combined with Forward Error Correction, allows for data recovery in the most challenging environments.
Mioty is also mobility-friendly (able to operate at 120 km/h).
Per-device AES encryption and authentication secures all communication.

In a Wittra Mioty network, you can not only connect MiotySense360 and click-ons, but also add
third-party Mioty sensors, as long as they comply with the standard Mioty blueprint format.
